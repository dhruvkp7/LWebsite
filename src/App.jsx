  <p>Leela,</p>
  <p> Three years ago, under the soft sky of the Park of Roses, everything began. I can still feel that moment as if it were yesterday‚Äîsitting with you, sharing momos for the very first time. I remember how my confidence on FaceTime dissolved the second I saw you in person. My hands trembled, my heart raced, and yet, with just a smile from you, all of that nervousness melted away. The words came easily, the laughter came naturally, and something inside me knew this was the start of something beautiful.</p>
  <p> Since that day, we have woven a whole new web of memories together. Through our college years, hand in hand, we‚Äôve laughed, explored, and built a world that feels entirely our own. We tried new foods that became favorites, discovered places that became chapters in our story, and stood proudly beside each other at our greatest accomplishments. You‚Äôve been my anchor, my confidant, my greatest adventure. I wouln't trust anyone with my feelings more than you</p>
  <p> What I treasure most are not only the big milestones, but the little things‚Äîthe late-night drives, the quiet study sessions, the simple joy of just being near you. Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas have been brighter because you were there; each season we‚Äôve passed through has felt warmer, fuller, more alive, simply because we shared it together.</p>
  <p> If I could, I would relive it all again‚Äîthe shaky hands of our first meeting, the countless shared meals, the journeys, the laughter, even the quiet moments in between‚Äîbecause every single moment with you has been a gift I would never trade.</p>
  <p> Leela, these three years with you have been the happiest years of my life. You are my heart‚Äôs constant, my greatest blessing, and the love that turns even the ordinary into something extraordinary. And as I look back on everything we‚Äôve shared, I feel even more grateful knowing this is only the beginning of our forever.</p>
  <p> I love you, endlessly and always.</p>
  <p> Yours forever, </p>
  <p>Dhruv</p>
